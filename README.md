Customer Churn Prediction using TensorFlow & Keras

Tools & Technologies: Python, TensorFlow (Keras), Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Project Overview

This project builds a binary classification model to predict customer churn from telecom data. It demonstrates a complete end-to-end machine learning pipeline, including data cleaning, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation using TensorFlow’s Sequential API.

Objective

Predict which customers are likely to churn, helping businesses implement proactive retention strategies and improve decision-making.

Approach

Data Preprocessing: Cleaned dataset, handled missing values, encoded categorical variables, scaled numerical features.

Feature Engineering: Created and transformed features to improve model performance.

Model Building: Developed a Sequential Neural Network using TensorFlow Keras.

Training & Evaluation: Compiled with binary_crossentropy loss and accuracy metric, trained the model, and visualized training history.

Results

Accurate churn prediction with strong generalization to unseen data.

Identified key factors influencing customer churn.

Demonstrates skills in deep learning, data preprocessing, and predictive modeling.
